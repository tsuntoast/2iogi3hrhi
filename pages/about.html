            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Erica, and I'm trying my best. I'm currently attending California State
                University, Los Angeles, where I am a freshman in the Honors College and a Computer
                Science major. I work at CollegeSpring as a mentor, helping juniors of underrepresented
                backgrounds at high schools in Los Angeles prepare for the SAT and college applications.
                I strive to set aside time for personal projects and improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm generally an open person and I don't aggressively defend my opinions. That being said,
                it must be said that I'm a cat person and I love pineapples on pizza. Make the judgements
                about me, if you wish.
            </p>
