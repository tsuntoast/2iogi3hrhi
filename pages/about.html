            <p>
                Hello, I'm Erica, and I'm trying my best. I'm currently attending California State
                University, Los Angeles, where I am a freshman in the Honors College and a Computer
                Science major. I work at CollegeSpring as a mentor, helping juniors of underrepresented
                backgrounds at high schools in Los Angeles prepare for the SAT and college applications.
                I strive to set aside time for personal projects and improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now I am a beginner in terms of overall experience. I am most skilled in Java
                programming. You can see the homework I do on my <a href="/pages/portfolio.html">
                portfolio</a>, although I cannot publicly display the source code for maintaining 
                academic integrity. This website is a side project and its purpose is to expose you
                to me and expose me to front-end development.
            </p>
